## 📖 About This Repository

This repository documents my entire learning journey across multiple cloud ecosystems. Every day, I study from Udemy courses, cloud documentation, and hands-on console labs using AWS & GCP. Along with learning theory, I build **deployable backend APIs**, **ETL data pipelines**, and **ML workflows** using Python and cloud-native services.

My goal is to build **real-world cloud engineering and data engineering skills**, not just pass exams.

---

## 📅 Daily Learning Structure

Every day I follow this four-part workflow:

### 1️⃣ **Git + GitHub**
- Maintain clean commits  
- Document notes daily  
- Track skills consistently  

### 2️⃣ **AWS Study**
- Udemy AWS Cloud Practitioner & Developer Associate  
- AWS documentation  
- Console labs + real service interactions  

### 3️⃣ **Python Practice**
- FastAPI  
- Data processing  
- Automation scripts  
- Backend engineering fundamentals  

### 4️⃣ **Google Cloud Study**
- Digital Leader → ACE → ML Engineer  
- Console labs  
- BigQuery, IAM, Cloud Run, Storage, Vertex AI  

---

## 🛠️ Projects

I will be adding multiple cloud projects here. Planned projects include:

### 🔸 **Project 1: Serverless Notes API (AWS)**
- FastAPI backend
